# Lab 3
https://isabelle-kr.github.io/fa22-cse110-lab3/

Note: I have a lot of commits/merges to main because I did not realize I could use the live preview feature from last week with CSS as well until pretty far into the lab, so I was putting things into main to preview them on the website. I now realize that since I can do this, when developing I should work on a branch until I have it right, and then merge it (hopefully only once) into main.
